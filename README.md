# Codedex-404-page # 

* I started this challenge with my partner - we had to create a 404 error page for Codédex.
* I managed the HTML and the CSS and he managed the JavaScript and some CSS.
* The page is literally simple, we wanted to be as similar as possible with the original Codédex page, with the same font, colors and design and we added a little game to have fun while the page is found :D
* The game consists in a player that has to catch 404 errors, meanwhile, you can catch some funny findings!
